                 interacting gravitationally, which results in a system of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically.
                   The velocity Verlet numerical method was employed to approximate solutions to these differential equations.
                    This method is particularly useful for problems in classical mechanics because it is accurate and stable.

          <p> A simulation of the dynamics of a particle in a cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator, was conducted using MATLAB.
            This simulation models the motion of a charged particle as it moves through both magnetic and electric fields.
             The equations of motion are quite simple so the Euler method was employed to approximate the particle's trajectory.
              Additionally, a kinetic energy graph is incorporated, allowing for real-time monitoring of the particle's energy state.

                 A computational study was conducted for a particle situated within a harmonic oscillator potential in both 2D and 3D. 
                The system's eigenstates can be represented using both Cartesian and polar coordinates, and both representations were meticulously explored.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p> 
                The study covered an extensive range of scenarios. The analyzed quantities included probability densities,
                 wave function phases, system probability currents, and expected values of quantities such as kinetic energy and angular momentum.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p> 
              In the most general case studied, the focus was on simulating the temporal evolution of a system starting
               from an arbitrary initial state, with a prime focus on its probability density. 
               This requires decomposing the initial state in eigenstates, and then add the time-dependent factor to each 
               eigenstate and add everything together. Given that this process involves several double integrals and 
               calculations using Hermite and Laguerre polynomials, it was necessary that the written code was highly efficient.
